# webscraping
This is one of many python notebooks i used for webscraping.
This time, the goal was to get the localisation of "Bodzio" shops across Poland, via API.

Sometimes, due to human error some data one the website is missing. This creates further trouble when working with the data, which needs to be completed manually at the end (hence the "try, except" statements).
